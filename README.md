## Fractals 3D Editor
Supports VR by A-Frame

### Idea
The same as with 2D fractals (a tree of branches), but now the branches are triangles in the 3D space. Not only the scale and angle between the current and previous branches are taken into account, but also the angle between their planes is considered.

#### To start
* npm i
* npm run dev
